Introduction:

This rpub contains data for several movies with 5 user reviews for each. All users are rating the same movies.  

This R markdown uses Azure MySQL to retrieve data.
![RPubs to Azure MySQL Connection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dapolloxp/data607/master/assignment2/MYSQL%20RStudio.jpg)
![The MySQL Database Schema looks as follows:](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dapolloxp/data607/master/assignment2/mysql%20db%20tables.png)
There is a movies table, a users table, and a movieratings table. There is a many to many relationship between users and movieratings.

### Install Required Packages
install.packages("DBI", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("tidyverse",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("magrittr", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("dplyr", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")

### Load Required Packages
library(DBI)
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
```
In this section we will make a connection to a Azure MySQL hosting the schema referenced above
```{r SQL Connection}
### Create SQL Connection
con <- dbConnect(RMariaDB::MariaDB(), user='rreadonly@cunyspsmysql', password="", dbname='moviereviews' ,host='cunyspsmysql.mysql.database.azure.com')

### Get a list of all SQL tables
dbListTables(con)
```
In this section we will pull the revelent information into a dataframe.
```{r SQL queries}
## Gather all important fields from the SQL DB for analysis
mysql_movies <- dbGetQuery(con, 'select u.username, u.firstname, u.lastname, m.title, m.category, m.length, mr.rating, mr.review from users as u
join users_movierating as umr on u.userid = umr.userid
                           join movierating as mr on umr.movieratingid = mr.movieratingid
                           join movies as m on mr.movieid = m.movieid;')

## Let's look at the first 10 rows
head(mysql_movies, n= 10)
## Check the dimensions of the data
dim(mysql_movies)
## Let's view our table headers
names(mysql_movies)
```
I want to group and create graphs based on the rating and create a chart. For this section, I will use dplyr
```{r}
## Group the titles by name and average the scores  using dplyr.
avg_movie_rating <- mysql_movies %>% group_by(title) %>% summarise(AvgRating=mean(rating))
```
Graph: Average Movie Review for each title
```{r}
## Graph movie titles vs the average score. 
gg <- ggplot(data = avg_movie_rating) + geom_point(mapping =aes(x= title, y=AvgRating, color = AvgRating))  
gg <- gg + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90), axis.line = element_line(color = "blue", size = 1, linetype = "solid"))  + xlab("Movie Title") + ylab("Average User Review")
gg + ggtitle("Average Movie Score Review")
##
```
Now, let's create a boxplot to determine how movie ratings compared for each category
```{r}
## Group Movies by category and average score using dplyr
avg_movie_rating <- mysql_movies %>% group_by(title) %>% summarise(AvgRating=mean(rating))
gg2 <- ggplot(data = mysql_movies, aes(x =category, y=rating)) + geom_boxplot(fill='#A4A4A4', color='blue')
gg2 + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0))  + xlab("Movie Category") + ylab("User Rating")
gg + ggtitle("User Rating per movie category")
```
Summary

Based on the sample of movies selected, it appears that animation and horror had a good year. We would need a much larger sample to determine which movies were the most popular.
```{r}
dbDisconnect(con)
```
